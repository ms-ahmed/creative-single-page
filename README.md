# DEVELOPMENT

This project is built with HTML, SASS, and JAVASCRIPT (VANILLA).

It is built with a gulp, a tools that allows me to run the tasks repetitive during the development.

        Reload the browser automatically whenever a file is saved

        Use preprocessors like Sass or LESS

        Optimize assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images (by mimifying the size of the files).

You can see the final result :
