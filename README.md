# DEVELOPMENT

This project is built with HTML, SASS, and JAVASCRIPT (VANILLA).

It is built with a gulp, a tools that allows me to run the tasks repetitive during the development.

Here I use it to :

        Spin up a web server (for development, not revelant when deployed in Netlify)

        Reload the browser automatically whenever a file is saved

        Use preprocessors like Sass or LESS

        Optimize assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images ( by mimifying the size of

        the files).

If you ever need to test the responsivness, please select actual devices, like Moto G4 or Galaxy5 and so on, because the Javascript needs to

You can see the final result :
